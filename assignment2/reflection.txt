Reflection Part Assignment 2

Rewriting the object-oriented version of this program from a functional perspective 
required me to rethink how each piece handled the data and how various variable were 
affected. While writing assignment one, I focused on grouping related data and 
functionality into classes that handled similar things. When writing the functional 
version in assignment two, I focused on breaking the program into smaller independent 
functions that passed data between them. When doing this, I ensured to use immutable 
variables and encapsulation and confined the input and output operations to the main 
piece of the program to "quarintine" necessary side effects of the program as a whole. 
Writing with a functional approach was more difficult in my opinion, trying to ensure 
there were no side effects and that each function conformed to the definition of a pure 
function, only prforming its intened action and passing the output appropriately. When
writing class to create objects it was easy to group these functionalities and no strict
adherence to these functional principles.
